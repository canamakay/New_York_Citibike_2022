# New_York_Citibike_2022

## Project Overview 
Citibike, New York's bike-sharing service, has been increasing in popularity since its inception in 2013.  Demand for bikes has especially risen after the Covid-19 pandemic and has led to distribution issues.  Customers are finding some stations to be sparse, thereby preventing them from renting bikes, and other stations to be full, preventing them from returning rented bikes.  This project aims to determine where and why issues arise.  Results of the study will be presented in an interactive dashboard and will aid the business strategy department to understand current bike distribution and decide where additional stations should be built.  

## Key Questions
- What are the most popular stations?
- What are the most popular end stations?
- What are the busiest times of year for Citibikers?
- What is the average temperature for each month?
- What percentage of bikes used are classic bikes?  Electric?
- In which areas are Citibikers travelling the most?
